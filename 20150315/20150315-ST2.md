#### GitHub and Your Markdown post

1 - Create a blogger repository in your github account
    Then, clone it into your local machine

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/rickhau/blogger.git
    ```

2 - Add .gitignore to exclude *.htm* and *.html* files.

    ```
      *.htm
      *.html
    ```

3 - Create a folder called 20150315 to put all the contents and images
    Then, commit it

    ```
      $ git commit -am "Add 20150315 post"
      $ git push -u origin master
    ```

4 - After commit, go to the github page to find the image link

    ```
    Take 01.png as an example:
    https://github.com/rickhau/blogger/blob/master/20150315/01.png
    ```

    Use above link in .md file to show up the iamge on your page.

   Type `html` to choose `Markdown Preview: Save to html`. 

  ![html](https://github.com/rickhau/blogger/blob/master/20150315/01.png)

  ![github](https://github.com/rickhau/blogger/blob/master/20150315/02.png)

  Then you should be able to see the html file generated in the same folder as your md file resides.
